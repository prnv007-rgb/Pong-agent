RL Pong Evolved
Description
RL Pong Evolved is a modern twist on the classic arcade game, where you face off against an AI opponent that learns and improves as you play. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this game introduces dynamic elements like moving obstacles, game-changing power-ups, and engaging visual effects to create a challenging and visually rich experience. The AI uses a Q-learning (Reinforcement Learning) model, starting with random movements and gradually adapting its strategy based on the outcome of each volley.

Features
Reinforcement Learning AI: Play against a smart AI that learns from its mistakes and successes.

Multiple Difficulty Levels: Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard to match your skill level. Each level adjusts the AI's speed and learning rate.

Dynamic Obstacles: Navigate around a moving block in the center of the field that can deflect the ball in unpredictable ways.

Power-Ups: Grab power-ups to gain an advantage! Make your paddle bigger or shrink the AI's paddle for a limited time.

Creative Visuals & Sound: Enjoy a retro-futuristic aesthetic with neon glows, a ball trail, screen shake on scores, and synthesized sound effects for an immersive arcade feel.

Customizable Experience: Select your preferred background color before starting the game.

Use the Start Menu to select a difficulty level and a background color.

Click "Start Game" to begin.

Move your mouse up and down to control the player's paddle (on the left).

The first player to score is the winner (or you can decide on a score limit!).

Click the "X" in the top-right corner to exit the match and return to the main menu.
